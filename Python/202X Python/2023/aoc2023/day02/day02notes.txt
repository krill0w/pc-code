todo:
- find highest total number of each type of ball from each game
    - remove game id info
    - split array into pulls (seperated by ;)
    - split remaining info into dictionary (?)
        - {'b': n1, 'r': n2, 'g': n3}
    - compare dictionary values to the limits
- eliminate all games that don't match the criteria
- find id total
