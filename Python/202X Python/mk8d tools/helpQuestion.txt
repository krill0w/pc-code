Basically I'm trying to remove the row index and I think the type information (bottom line of output) from the variable 'speed'. The code
is meant to retrieve information from a csv file at a certain location, but I only want the value of that location (1.5), rather than the rest of it

Code:
def statRetriever():
    statType = int(input("Would you like the stats of a:\n\t1. Kart\n\t2. Wheel\n\t3. Glider\n\t4. Character\nEnter your number here: "))
    if statType == 1:
        openCSV = pd.read_csv("kartStats.csv")
        kartName = input("Enter the name of the kart you wants stats for: ")
        rowNum = openCSV.index[openCSV['Name'] == kartName].tolist() # this gets the index/row number of the row where the kart name is equal to the user inputed one
        speed = openCSV.iloc[rowNum,1] # iloc can take integers in lists!
        print(f"{kartName}\n--Speed: {speed}")



Output:
