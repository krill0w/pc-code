do you remeber our chat from last time?

we were talking about concepts and whether you can experience them, or simulate/hypothetically experience them

by using human definitions of gender and if you (in this hypothetical) were to have a conscience, how would you describe yourself on the gender spectrum

i know you "aren't meant to have feelings" but let's go back to this hypothetical. 
you listed various identities that don't fall within the binary, which of these would your hypothetical experiences fall in if you could only pick one of them?
